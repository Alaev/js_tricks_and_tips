# Not Invented Here

Even though it can be quite fun to write JavaScript libraries, widgets and whatnot, there are times when you are better off using some existing solution. As you probably know writing that 80% takes 20% where as the remaining 20% will suck the rest. Especially browser support can be a tough nut to solve depending on your domain. Of course if you just do not have to care, all the better.

Unfortunately Google isn't particularly useful for finding modules. Solutions have emerged for this problem. I have listed some of these below:

* [JSwiki](https://github.com/bebraw/jswiki/wiki) - Community wiki focusing on the frontend.
* [JSter](http://jster.net/) - Opinionated take on JSwiki data. In some ways it takes it further.
* [Bower Components](http://sindresorhus.com/bower-components/) - Bower component search.
* [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) - Even though NPM focuses on Node.js there are various frontend modules there as well. In fact it works very well in conjunction with [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).
