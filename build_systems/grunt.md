# Grunt

In `grunt` you define specific tasks for particular purposes (ie. running that LiveReload server). It is possible to run multiple of these tasks at the same time. And it is possible to define custom tasks and plugins based on your needs.

I won't go into details. Rather examine [Grunt documentation](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) and [an example project](https://github.com/bebraw/libtemplate.js) I've set up. The example project is sort of meta in sense that you can use it as a base for your own GitHub based library project.

`grunt` tends to develop quite fast. In the past this lead to some breakage when newer versions of the tool came out. Remember to refer to a specific version of Grunt in your `package.json` to avoid this group of problems.
