# Conclusion

In this chapter I highlighted the importance of build systems and discussed one, `Grunt`. It is a very good idea to use this type of tool. It may seem like a lot of work initially but it streamlines development somewhat as pretty much all you need to do is to type `grunt` and you've got a development server running that is smart enough to support your workflow. This lets you focus on real problems rather than having to spend too much time at the terminal.
