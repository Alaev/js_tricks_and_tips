# AltJS

Since JavaScript isn't really everyone's cup of tea, or coffee. Various languages that compile to JavaScript have emerged. Usually these languages provide some constructs not found in the core language. You may gain better type checking or some syntactical sugar.

> [altJS](http://smurfpandey.github.io/altjs/) lists many of these languages. If you have time, go and check out a few. Personal recommendations: [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/), [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).

Some daredevils use [emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) to run arbitrary code in JavaScript. It is a system built on top of [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) and makes many perhaps a bit crazy things possible. You can for instance play [Dune 2](http://play-dune.com/) or [Transport Tycoon Deluxe](http://play-ttd.com/) in your browser. How retro is that?
