# A Misunderstood Language?

As you might know the first version of JavaScript was developed in mere two weeks at 1995 by a fellow named Brendan Eich over at Netscape Corporation. [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/) can be considered a successor of it. You most likely recognize the name. Yes, they are behind the web browser. In fact they built that on the remains of Netscape.

Initially the language was known as LiveScript but the marketing men decided JavaScript sounds more convincing. After all it was the decade of Java so anything with Java in it must have felt like a killer product. And in a way the legacy of Java still lives on although not in the way envisioned. On retrospect it wasn't a good choice to name the language as JavaScript and a lot of confusion has ensued. Java is to JavaScript as ham is to hamster. Keep that in mind!
