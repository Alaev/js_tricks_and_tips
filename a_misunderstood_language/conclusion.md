# Conclusion

JavaScript is a misunderstood kid. As the wise say, thou shalt not judge a programming language by its name. So please avoid that. Even though there's a J word in its name, it doesn't mean you will get pimples by using it. JavaScript is a surprisingly powerful, and these days popular, language that in essence is the language of the web. Learn it and the world shall bow before you.

Since in this chapter I more or less just waved hands around and hopefully piqued your interest enough, I recommend checking out the next chapter in which I examine the [[current state]] of JavaScript, our hero language.
