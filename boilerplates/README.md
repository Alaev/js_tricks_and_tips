# Boilerplates

Each JavaScript developer comes up with his own way to structure projects. There is no single standard to follow. Still, a number of boilerplates have emerged. [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) is perhaps the most high profile one of these. It uses `Grunt`, a build tool, I discussed earlier. I've listed various other boilerplates below:

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [BoilerplateJS](http://boilerplatejs.org/)
* [JavaScript-Boilerplate](https://github.com/mdarif/JavaScript-Boilerplate)
* [javascript-project-boilerplate](https://github.com/young-steveo/javascript-project-boilerplate)
* [JavaScript Library Boilerplate](http://denis.io/jslibraryboilerplate/)
* [libtemplate.js](http://bebraw.github.io/libtemplate.js/)

It may be at least worth your while to investigate these alternatives. Take note of the way they structure the code and the tools you use. You may find something to pick up.
