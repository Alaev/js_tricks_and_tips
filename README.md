# JavaScript Developer's Survival Guide

Have you ever felt lost with JavaScript or felt that your skills could use a bit of sharpening? If so you found the right place!

JavaScript Developer's Survival Guide is an ongoing project (early stages) that goes through the difficult bits and gathers around valuable resources. In this way it complements [jster.net](http://jster.net). Now the focus is more on conceptual rather than library side.

The guide is developed over at the [wiki](https://github.com/bebraw/js-dev-survival-guide/wiki) so head there for the content. Later on I'll create a nice frontend for that. My long term goal (April) is to take the best parts of the content and turn it into a presentation at a local developer conference and perhaps publish a small booklet based on it even.
