# Survive JavaScript - a Web Developer's Guide

Have you ever felt lost with JavaScript or felt that your skills could use a bit of sharpening? If so you found the right place!

In this guide I will go through some of the rocky spots and give you the tools needed to get past them. JavaScript is one of those languages that can hurt you bad if you don't know what you are doing. Fortunately once you come in terms with the nature of the language you might actually enjoy using it.

After all it is the language of the web. If you can develop in JavaScript, you can achieve a lot! And it's not just about the frontend. Thanks to the rise of Node.js and related technologies it has become an option at the backend too. You can even program embedded devices using it. It truly is the lingua franca of programming languages.
