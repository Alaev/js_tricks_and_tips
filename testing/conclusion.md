# Conclusion

I hope this brief chapter gave you some idea about how to test your JavaScript code. Rather than having to develop a framework of your own I recommend checking out [some established alternatives](http://jster.net/category/testing-frameworks) and ones to use based on your needs.

In case you end up developing a framework of your own, check out [Test Anything Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol). Using that as a format allows your testing tools to hook into a larger testing ecosystem. You can display test results very easily using some existing parser for instance.
