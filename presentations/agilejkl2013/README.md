# Survive JS - Presentation

Presentation slides for my [AgileJkl 2013](http://www.agilejkl.com) talk.

## Development

1. `compass watch`
2. `devwatch 'slides.md$' './render.py'` # requires devwatch Node.js utility
3. `./serve.sh`

After these have been executed, just modify `slides.md` and enjoy the results at a web browser (localhost:8000). I know this process could be streamlined but it's good enough for now.

## Presenting

Run with `?presentme=true` set to access the presenter mode (separate windows and controls).
