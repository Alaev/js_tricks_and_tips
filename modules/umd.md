# UMD

As a library author it isn't unfortunately enough to stick to just one module definition (or plain old global). Especially if you wish to reach to a larger possible pool of users. This is where something ugly but practical known as [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) comes in.

It is a collection of patterns that allow you to support multiple module systems at once depending on your needs. It's so ugly I rather spare you from the details. Go and check it yourself if you dare.
