# Might Run on Your Toaster

What makes JavaScript interesting is the fact that it is supported by a wide range of hardware already. Just imagine the mobile devices around that can execute it. Most likely you already have one in your pocket. And that is not counting all the desktop systems. It is as ubiquitous as a language can get. In some ways it can be considered the assembly language of the web generation. It is that important.

Even though traditionally JavaScript has been thought as a language to be used in web browser, you may use it in various other contexts as well. Node.js provides an example of a server-side usage. [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) is an example of a framework allowing you to develop applications in a mobile context. Compared to pure browser based services the platform yields a better access to the hardware.

It is possible to use JavaScript to control electronics, possibly including your toaster. Look around for various Node.js libraries. You will also find support for the popular [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) platform.
