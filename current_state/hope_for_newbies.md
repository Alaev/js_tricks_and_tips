# Still Hope for Newbies

If you have not hopped into the JavaScript train yet, it is a good time to do so now. It's not too late. In fact a lot of development is going on. Newest developments include the introduction of `MVC frameworks` on the frontend side. `Reactive programming` is another newcomer.

It is funny how sometimes old concepts are new again. I guess that might have something to do with programmer generations and the development of hardware. Old, discarded techniques become feasible as hardware isn't the constraint anymore. Or we're just good figuring out how to make even the new machines crawl.

There has also been development on the asynchronous side. Solutions have been provided that allow us to deal with callbacks in better ways. `Promises` for instance obscure callbacks altogether and provide a `declarative` alternative for them. In a way reactive programming is yet another solution.

If that sounded like technobabble to you, don't worry. I still recommend researching the concepts. There should be plenty of material available.
