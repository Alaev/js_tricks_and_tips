# ES6 - The Future

The language itself is headed towards a brighter future with [ES6](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ES6_plans). The specification promises to bring forth improvements such as long awaited modules, several language constructs and overall just standard ways of doing things so we can avoid reinventing the wheel ourselves. In fact you can mimic some of the planned features already but obviously it won't look or feel as good. On example of this is generators. I'll discuss this particular case later at [[Language Features]].

Even if ES6 was finalized tomorrow, it will take quite a while for browsers to catch up. Thanks to legacy and the fact that we cannot go and update everyone's software to support the newest tricks there will be a transition period. The most likely scenario is that those who wish to adopt ES6 features will include them into their builds and transpile the code into something that is ES4 compatible. This situation is not far from what people are doing already with languages that compile into JavaScript and seems very realistic to me.

It is possible that ES6 efforts fail for a reason or another. That is not my problem, though. In fact you can use some of the features already if you really want. Just find a transpiler. I would avoid this for now while things settle down.
