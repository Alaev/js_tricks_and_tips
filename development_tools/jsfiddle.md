# jsFiddle, jsbin, jsdo.it and co.

Services such as [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/), [jsbin](http://jsbin.com/) and [jsdo.it](http://jsdo.it/) form an entire category of their own. These are development tools that operate directly within your browser. Sometimes I use them to prototyping solutions. Nothing is more fun than the type of interactive development they allow.

The tools are a bit lacking on collaborative department. It is not possible to modify the same code at the same time yet. Also the way they deal with versioning can be a bit interesting. Cloud9 IDE is a solution that aims to fix these problems.
