# Chrome Inspector and Firebug

These days browsers have very powerful tools in them. I like to use [Chrome Inspector](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/) a lot. It comes with a simple JavaScript console and allows me to tweak the structure of the page I am editing. Longer term we will see a [better integration between Inspector and editors](http://sokolovstas.github.io/SublimeWebInspector/). I cannot await to see that day myself.

[Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) is something more or less equivalent for Mozilla Firefox. There is also a light version available you can embed on your site even. This may be useful for developing on mobile although there are likely better solutions available.

It is very much worth your while to learn to use these tools. They allow you to inspect, modify and learn very fast. They are still quite isolated from actual editors but as I mentioned the future might be more integrated.
