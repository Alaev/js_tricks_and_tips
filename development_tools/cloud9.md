# Cloud9 IDE

Web development belongs to web. At least that what the [Cloud9](http://c9.io/) guys seem to believe. Their service integrates well with GitHub and allows you to do more serious development in web. I don't use their service actively but it seems there might be some kind of a future for services such as this. There is something innately powerful in the concept.
