# LiveReload

As a web developer you have likely hit `ctrl-r` or a similar shortcut enough. Fret not! You can escape this by using a solution such as [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/). By using it the browser will refresh itself. Technically it is quite simple. On browser side you have a plugin which communicates with a server that watches the files you modify. When a file has been modified (and saved) it will trigger refresh. In case of LiveReload changes made to CSS are made on the page without a refresh allowing fast iteration.

I know it might sound like a small thing. In practice small things such as this count, though, and allow you to focus on the essential rather than refreshing the page while you are iterating.
