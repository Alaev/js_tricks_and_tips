# Development Tools

You can develop JavaScript code pretty much using any editor you want. Given the language has been somewhat loosely typed you won't benefit from an IDE that much. You can, however, improve the experience by using various tools and plugins.

The situation will improve in the future thanks to solutions such as [tern](https://github.com/marijnh/tern) that promise to take the editing experience to the next level.

I personally use [vim](http://www.vim.org/) and a couple of JavaScript related plugins. If you are looking for something more commercial, [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) may be interesting alternatives. I am absolutely certain [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is a great editor too when configured correctly.
